import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Button variant="destructive">
      Delete
    </Button>
  )
}

// This is perhaps more like App.js

// Some pointers on ShadCn -> We can go inside the Button and change the variants and sizes and use them repeatatively.
